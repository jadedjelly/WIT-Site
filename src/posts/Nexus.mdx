## What is Nexus Repository?

**Nexus Repository (often called Nexus Repo)** is a repository manager developed by **Sonatype**.
It helps development teams **store, organize, and distribute software components, dependencies, and build artifacts** in a reliable and secure way.

Think of it like a **warehouse for software packages**.

## Why Use Nexus Repository?

- **Artifact Storage**
  Store build outputs (e.g., JARs, Docker images, npm packages, Python wheels, Helm charts).

- **Proxy & Caching**
  Acts as a proxy for public repositories (Maven Central, npm registry, PyPI, Docker Hub).
  Cached artifacts reduce network dependency and speed up builds.

- **Reliability & Security**
  Centralized control over dependencies ensures only approved libraries are used.

- **Faster Builds**
  Dependencies are served locally, improving CI/CD performance.

- **Multi-Format Support**
  Supports Maven, npm, PyPI, Docker, NuGet, RubyGems, Helm, and more.
---
## Editions

- **Nexus Repository OSS**
  Free, open-source version with core functionality.

- **Nexus Repository Pro**
  Enterprise edition with advanced security, analytics, and high availability.

## Nexus vs Other Repository Managers

While Nexus Repo is widely adopted, there are alternatives such as:

- **JFrog Artifactory** – similar feature set, enterprise-focused.
- **GitHub Packages** – integrated directly into GitHub for code + packages.
- **Azure Artifacts** – part of Microsoft’s DevOps ecosystem.

Nexus Repo’s strength lies in **wide format support, stability, and strong community adoption**.
