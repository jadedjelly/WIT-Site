Back in late 2019, I was working as an IT ops manager (I filled all roles, from the lowly IT eng manning the trenches on the frontlines, to the IT manager running budgets, testing new s/w
 and so on) for a software development firm that specialised in Tax systems. When I started in the role, their active
directory Domain services were being run through a Win VM on Azure, while also running Azure Active directory (now known as EntraID), as you can imagine any issues
on one were replicated on the other, and to add some extra spice to the mix, they had a backup AD running on prem in another office.
One of the major issues, were accounts that had never been deactivated (the oldest at the time was 8 years), were accessible to anyone that requested the access.
Other issues included, group policies running from their on-prem, OS & S/W updates as and when kicked off, zero control over browser extensions, no control over user profile
s/w installations (an easy way to get around admin cred needs), no Asset reg of who had what. A few 100 tickets in a system no one monitored, prior to me starting, the company
were using a MSP (which prior to me starting as the IT manager, I was the MSPs newest Senior Engineer), I was sent to the company, due to constant complaints from both sides.
On the side of the MSP, the complaints ranged from no information given about their in house s/w outside of what it did (which would be normal), to not getting full access to the azure landscape (again normal to a degree),
on the side of the company, their complaints were a managerie of no tickets being closed, or tickets taking months to close or engineers coming onsite and sitting in the loo for "far too long"...
