summary: "As a Red Dwarf fan teaching myself the Feynman Technique, I explain it like showing Holly, fixing the gaps like Kryten, and polishing it until even Cat thinks it’s fabulous."

<TLDR>
Take a subject, explain it for Red Dwarf fans
</TLDR>

So, the Feynman Technique is basically learning like Lister trying to fix Starbug’s engine with a bent spoon and a half-empty lager can: if you can explain what you’re doing to Kryten, and he doesn’t explode with pedantry, you probably get it.

## The steps go something like this:

1. Pick a topic – Doesn’t matter if it’s quantum mechanics or how to play poker with a polymorph.
2. Explain it simply – Imagine you’re Holly after losing 9,500 IQ points. If you can describe it so even he gets it without buffering for six hours, you’re on the right track.
3. Find the gaps – This is where you realise you’ve smegged it. If you can’t explain it without using ten-dollar words, you don’t actually understand it. Kryten would spot this immediately, politely pointing out: “Sir, that’s not an explanation. That’s just regurgitating a textbook like a GELF with indigestion.”
4. Simplify and use analogies – Swap jargon for Cat-level fabulousness. Don’t say “electromagnetic radiation,” say “shiny light that makes my suit sparkle.” The clearer and sillier the better — because if you can explain it to the Cat, you’re golden.
5. Repeat until smooth – Just like Rimmer rehearsing his salute in the mirror, you keep refining until it’s sleek, polished, and you can say it without sounding like a malfunctioning Talkie Toaster.

## Why it works?

* __Richard Feynman’s__ teaching style: He used analogies from everyday life (like wobbling plates) — reading about his anecdotes can give you richer, funnier comparisons.

* __Why it works (cognitively)__: It forces active recall and exposes the illusion of knowledge (thinking you know something just because you’ve read it).

* __Variations__: Some people adapt the method for writing flashcards, or explaining to an imaginary 12-year-old.

## Who or what is / was Red Dwarf

Red Dwarf is a British sci-fi comedy TV series that started in 1988. It’s often described as “a sitcom in space”, but with a very quirky, very British sense of humor.

The nuts & bolts:

The show takes place aboard the Red Dwarf, a giant mining spaceship.

The main character, Dave Lister, is a lazy, slobby technician who accidentally becomes the last living human after a radiation leak wipes out the crew.

He’s kept company by:

* Arnold Rimmer – his uptight, cowardly, and annoying bunkmate, brought back as a hologram.

* The Cat – a humanoid evolved from Lister’s pet cat, obsessed with fashion and himself.

* Kryten – a fussy service robot, who’s overly polite and neurotic.

* Plus a ship’s computer, Holly, who’s witty but not always reliable.

The show mixes sci-fi ideas (time travel, alternate dimensions, AI, weird aliens) with sitcom-style banter and absurd situations. Think of it as Star Trek, but if the crew were hopeless losers just trying to survive, eat curry, and insult each other.

It’s known for:

* Low-budget but creative special effects.

* Clever writing that blends slapstick, wordplay, and surprisingly thoughtful sci-fi.

* Its cult status – it’s one of the UK’s most beloved long-running comedies.

* __So in short: Red Dwarf is about a slacker, a hologram, a vain cat-person, and a neurotic robot bumbling through space in a big red ship, while cracking jokes and stumbling into bizarre adventures.__
